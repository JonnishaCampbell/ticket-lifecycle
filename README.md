For the last part of the project, practice creating, triaging, and solving tickets.
I logged in as Kenny Ken needing tech support assistance resetting his password. I also created a ticket as Jenny Jen who needs tech support for her frozen computer. After creating tickets, I logged into the administrator account to separate the tickets between the other two agents.

I logged into Agent John's profile and saw a ticket assigned to him. From there, he can reply and work on the ticket for the user. If additional tickets were given, he could work on them based on priority or suggestions from the supervisor.
